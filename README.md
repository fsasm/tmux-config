# tmux-config

Install with `cp tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf`.

This config needs [Nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) installed and used by
the terminal. Also [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
must be installed. This can be achieved with 
`git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`.
